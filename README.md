# C343-work
This is all my code for the IU Bloomington C343 class

# Notes to other IU Students
If you come across this and are hoping to cheat, please reconsider as you will not develop the skills you need to. Feel free to use this as a reference and send me any messages or leave any critque you imagine as fair as I am hoping to grow and this code base reflects me progressively learning about data structures and algorithms in Java.
