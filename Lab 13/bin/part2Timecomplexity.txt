Time complexity for Radix sorting:

n = number of elements
d = number of digit places you need to process


after some thought and implementing the algorithm, I realized the time complexity
which as I understand it is defined by the loops you use.

so for this problem, I think the time complexity will be O(n^d)

I will also include this in submission comment!
