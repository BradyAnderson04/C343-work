Here are my observations on the search algorithms I implemented.


Firstly the difference between binary and linear search was very apparent in speed. It seems that 
sorted data sets are much better to work with becasue we can assume various features about their 
contents that help us do less computation.

Additionally since I am not using complex data structures it doesn't seem that the time is slowed too much, but I
imagine as more complex/useful structures are used time will go up due to more values being dealt with.

Secondly the use of arrays vs arraylists was very interesting. The time difference was also very apparent in linear search it
showed across the board using arraylists was much slower than using arrays. The advantage of arraylist though is not lost with
the few milliseconds that are gained in search time. However my inexperience may be the reason for thinking that.

For binary search there wasn't much of a difference between arraylists and arrys.
